--BUGS--
--------
1. Typing too fast in the middle of already typed characters (eg to correct spelling) can cause weird output and possible segfaults.

2. Typing more than a few ESCs will cause a series of ANSI escape codes that can lead to weird output.  Has not crashed due to these though, simply clear them.

-----------------------
